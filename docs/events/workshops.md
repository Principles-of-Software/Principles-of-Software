# Workshops

Workshops are an important part of the RCOS experience. They strengthen the presenters communication skills and inform the audience about a skill or technology
pertinent to their open source work.

## Hosting a workshop

Anyone in RCOS is allowed to host a workshop. Mentors are required to host at least one.

Workshops have historically be hosted mostly on Wednesdays, since most Computer Science majors at RPI are free on Wednesday afternoons. Despite this,
there is no requirement to what day you host a workshop on. Weekends are acceptable, as are most days of the week, as long as your workshop does not conflict
with a Large Group meeting or Small Group meeting.

## Topic Requirements

It is required that workshops are pertinent to open source software or the open source community. This is more flexible than many people might expect.

In general, all workshops that teach a skill are acceptable. This can be anything from building a PC to updating your resume to creating an effective presentation.
The reason for this is that these are all skills that will help people in the open source community (and by extension in RCOS) do their work or get a job. It's
mostly difficult to find a skill that would not be useful to open source developers. If you are in doubt or have questions though, feel free to reach out to a
coordinator or faculty advisor.

Workshops that focus on a specific technology or protocol should be sure that the technology is open source. There are some exceptions,
for example Git is open source but GitHub is not. Despite being closed source, GitHub (or parts of it like GitHub Actions) would obviously be an acceptable
workshop topic since they are used by so many open source projects and cater directly to the open source community. Once again if you are unsure if your topic is
acceptable please reach out to a coordiantor or faculty advisor.

## Time limits

Workshops should aim for 30 - 45 minutes in length. Any workshop that go longer should give the attendance code to attendees by the 50 minute mark.
