# Inclement Weather Policy

## Overview

We at RCOS understand that it may be difficult or unsafe to get to campus during inclement weather. Below are our policies on cancelling or dismissing RCOS meetings due to inclement weather.

## Weekday Meetings and Events
If classes are not in session due to inclement weather, any RCOS events that occur during that day will also be cancelled. These events include:
- Large Group
- Friday Workshops
- Small Group
- Weekday Work/Bonus Sessions

Large Groups that are cancelled might be rescheduled to another RCOS period to make up.

## Weekend or Holiday Events

If RPI's shuttle service or Safe Ride program is suspended due to inclement weather when classes are not in session, any RCOS events occurring on that day will be cancelled. This includes:
- Weekend work sessions
- Code Jams
- RCOS Hackathons
- Weekend bonus sessions

If a shuttle service or Safe Ride suspension is announced during an RCOS event, event hosts reserve the right to dismiss the event early so that attendees can get home safely.

In the final 3 weeks of the Fall semester and the first half of the Spring semester, event hosts are encouraged to set aside a "snow date" for any code jams, hackathons, or weekend bonus sessions.
