# Small Group Meetings

!> We are still adapting to the return to restricted in-person courses. This information may change.

## Overview
Small Group meetings are where the majority of RCOS project work gets done. Once projects are finalized at the start of the semester, projects are grouped into Small Groups overseen by a Mentor or two and are assigned to a room, typically in Sage. During Small Group meetings, you have time to work and discuss with your team, collaborate with other projects, and get help from your Mentor(s).

## Time and Frequency
Small Group meetings take place during regularly schedule RCOS sections on Tuesdays and Fridays from 4pm to 5:50pm. Attendance is required, with details listed [here](grading/attendance). Members are expected to work for the majority of the period. Attendance is generally taken after an hour and a half to ensure members are coming and staying.

## Location
Small Groups are assigned to small rooms, typically in Russell Sage Laboratory. Each Small Group (and project) is also given their own Discord voice and text channels on the server which they are encouraged to actively use.

## Agenda
Your Mentor(s) will run the Small Group meeting. It will start with a short presentation prepared by the Coordinators to give general RCOS announcements and updates. Then the agenda is up to the Mentor(s), though the majority of the time will always be given to Open Hacking (see below). Mentors are required to keep up-to-date on your projects so they might do this by having a standup where everyone in the room quickly recounts their progress and blockers, or they might speak individually to projects and team members.

## Open Hacking
The majority of Small Group meeting time should be actual development work on your project. This is when project leads can directly speak with the whole team, delegate tasks, troubleshoot, and manage their project. Mentors can be called in if available to help with technical blockers.
