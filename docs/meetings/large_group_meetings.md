# Large Group Meetings

!> We are still adapting to the return to restricted in-person courses. This information may change.

## Overview
Large Group is when the entirety of RCOS gathers for announcements, guest speakers, town hall meetings, or opening/closing ceremonies.


## Time and Frequency
During the first two weeks of the semester, Large Group occurs every Tuesday and Friday to get new community members acquainted with RCOS and to inform existing members on changes in structure and mentorship.

Once all community members are assigned to a Small Group, Large Group will only occur on one or two Fridays per month. All other Fridays are reserved for Small Group meetings.

Large group will also occur on the last Friday of the semester for our closing ceremony. 

## Announcements
Each Large Group meeting's slides have an announcements section where Coordinators/Faculty Advisors announce important events both in RCOS and external. RCOS members who have interesting announcements about external events or anything else they feel worth sharing with everyone can ask a Coordinator to briefly talk during the Large Group meeting. Don't be hesitant to, we heavily encourage participation! We take note of particularly engaged RCOS members.

## Guest Speakers
!> We currently are not allowed to host visitors on campus, so guest speakers would dial in to meetings through WebEx.

RCOS welcomes guest speakers to present their work or research and how it encorporates open-source software. Every once in a while a guest speaker will be given time to present during a Large Group meeting for everyone. These can be anyone from RPI faculty to external companies. These will be announced ahead of time. Guest speakers presentations generally should not be longer than 40 minutes.
