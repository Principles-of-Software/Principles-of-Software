Faculty Advisors are the RPI faculty members that support RCOS on the administrative side. They are technically the instructors assigned to the RCOS course each semester. They are vital to the existence and success of RCOS!

## Responsibilities

Faculty Advisors manage the heavy lifting of the administration of RCOS, including:

- interfacing with RPI
- course registration issues
- management of RCOS Submitty
- management of Venue
- final grading

Faculty Advisors work with each semester's Coordinators to manage RCOS and determine its direction for the semester. They have RCOS experience built up over years and years as opposed to Coordinators who typically are around for 2-4 years.
