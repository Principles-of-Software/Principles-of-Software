# Pre-Semester Agenda

?> Spring 2022's agenda is a little different as we are delaying Project Pairing by a meeting in order to do it in-person. In the future, there might be one less meeting before Project Pairing.

While difficult to plan when on break, it is vital that Coordinators and Faculty Advisors meet a 1-2 times before each semester starts. Refer to the checklist for the basic tasks that need to be completed before the semester commences.

# Semester Agenda

The first fews weeks of each semester is an extremely important time to get new students acquainted with RCOS, old students updated on any changes in structure/leadership, assigning Mentors and a handful of other tasks. This is the most important time for the Coordinators to be "on top of things".

## Outline

All of the following details need to be worked out within the first two weeks

- RCOS Intro & Overview
- Project Pitches
- Project Pairing
- Proposal Approval
- Small Group Formation & Mentor Assignments

## First Meeting - Intro & Overview

The first meeting is to be held on the first Tuesday or Friday of classes, whichever comes first.

The first meeting begins with the introduction slides, presented by the student Coordinators. The slides go through the stucture of RCOS and how to participate. A Faculty Advisor will then give a talk on the [history](/overview/history) of RCOS, and briefly explain some administrative details.

The expectations of working on a project for credit are defined. The rubric is explained with emphasis on changes / improvements from the previous year based on feedback from students and mentors. Coordinators should be careful not to sound stringent or cold, while making clear that working on a project for credit does require a commitment and the students' best effort.

<!-- TODO: Return to after Spring 2022
After expectations are defined, students are reminded how to pitch their projects the following meeting. Pitch slides are collected by a Coordinator until 11:59PM the night before the second meeting.

Existing projects are reminded to submit proposals. Existing projects are asked to fill out a form expressing their Small Group mentor/technology preference.

Immediately following the end of this meeting, members interested in mentoring should remain and Mentor Training should start from the [guidelines](mentoring/training).

**First Meeting Master Checklist**

- [ ] Create meeting slides for Day 1
  - [ ] copy from [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aqTm8X3N4ZITOKqKQTNMmEdLUHe3V9IgORNm5kuBTPY/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] Schedule Mentor Training immediately after meeting slides

## Second Meeting - Install Fest and Intro to Git

TODO

## Third AND Fourth Meetings - Project Pitches

The next two meetings are dedicated solely to project pitches. Each pitch should be no more than one minute long, although exceptions are sometimes made for 'special' projects. Returning projects should be put first in the pitch order, to set an example for new projects.

Additional information should be kept to the minimum. Students should be encouraged to get in touch with project leaders and mentors for help picking a project.

**Project Pitches Master Checklist**

- [ ] Collect pitches from projects **who want to pitch**
  - [ ] ensure pitches are only 1 slide and have required info
  - [ ] contact Project Leads for missing pitch info
- [ ] Create public Discord channels only for pitching projects
  - [ ] post link to pitch in channel
- [ ] Compile pitches into meeting slides
- [ ] Determine how external projects will pitch
- [ ] Announce pitches and pitch order on Discord
  - [ ] Ensure external project mentors understand how to pitch or have sent a recording

## Fifth Meeting - Project Pairing & Proposal Approval

The third meeting has two main parts that occur simultaneously: [Project Pairing](membership/project_pairing) and proposal approval. The mentors should be split evenly between the two events, with each occuring in its own location. Finding a project can be very nervewracking for newcomers, so Project Pairing is intended to ensure every student finds a project.

<!-- TODO: what the heck do we mean by this section https://github.com/rcos/rcos-handbook/issues/146 -->

In the second room, mentors should be present to look over student's proposals and approve them. If a proposal does not meet the guidelines, mentors should assist the project members in modifying their proposal.

_Every for-credit student must be on a project with an approved proposal by the end of the fourth meeting._

## Sixth Meeting - First Small Group

This meeting should be the first Small Group meeting of the semester. Projects should be grouped into Small Groups and assigned Mentors based on preferences and project-Mentor skillset matches so that Mentors can best provide technical assistance when needed. All students should be informed of their Small Groups prior to this meeting via Discord. Instead of meeting all together in one location, everyone should report directly to their assigned Small Group rooms. A Coordinator or Faculty Advisor should remain in the main meeting room to direct any stragglers that missed the message to go to their assigned Small Group location.

At least one mentor meeting excluding mentor training must occur prior to the fourth meeting. Mentors should be instructured to ensure that mentees:

1. Are on [rcos.io](https://rcos.io).
2. Are on [Discord](https://rcos.io/register)

Any larger goals for the year should be made clear and a schedule for mentor meetings should be set.
