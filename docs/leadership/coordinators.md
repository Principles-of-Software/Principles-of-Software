# Coordinators

The RCOS Coordinators are a small group of RCOS members who work alongside the Faculty Advisors to manage the course. They are typically selected from Mentors.

## Responsibilities

RCOS Coordinators have a myriad of responsibiities:

- determining the overarching direction of RCOS
- planning each meeting
- maintaining slides, forms, data in Google Drive
- developing and maintaining RCOS infrastructure and accounts
- final grading at the end of each semester

## Selecting New Coordinators

Coordinators are typically Mentors who have stood out over multiple semesters for upholding RCOS' values, furthering its mission, and going above and beyond to take care of their Small Groups and the greater RCOS community. Each semester, Coordinators are on the lookup for promising new Mentors to join their ranks if there is a need. Not every semester will result in new Coordinators being selected, but it is common as typically each year a few senior Coordinators graduate. Mentors can also contact Faculty Advisors or current Coordinators to request becoming a Coordinator if they believe themselves to be a good fit, and they will be considered by the group. There is nothing wrong with declining an offer to become a Coordinator, as it certainly means a lot of extra busy work that might take away from managing a project or Small Group.
