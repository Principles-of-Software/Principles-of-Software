# Notes and Retrospectives

In Fall 2021, the private [rcos/rcos-notes](https://github.com/rcos/rcos-notes) repository was created to store Coordinator meeting notes and retrospectives. It is extremely important to document meeting notes and retrospectives as so much knowledge is lost when experienced Coordinators or Faculty Advisors leave.

## Role of Scribe

At the start of each semester, a Coordinator should be selected to be the scribe who takes down meeting notes and uploads them to the repository. A backup scribe should also be selected in cases where the original is unavailable.

## Semester Retrospectives

At the end of each semester, a new file should be added to the `retrospectives/` directory that lays out the **at least** the following categories:

- Meetings
- Attendance
- Infrastructure
- Handbook
- Community

Each Coordinator and Faculty Advisor should take the time to add a comment on each section. This explicit information is invaluable not just for planning the next semester but also for future Coordinators to look back on and learn from.
