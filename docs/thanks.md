## Acknowledgements

The design and spirit of this repository is based on the [RCOS Handbook](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/), the document for which another RPI class, Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS), is based off of.  That document is maintained and updated by CS Department Faculty and the student coordinators who make it all happen.

This textbook would also not be possible without:

Dr. Ana Milanova,

Dr. David Goldschmidt,

Dr. Carlos Varela,

Dr. Michael Ernst (of University of Washington),

Professor Thompson,

All of Principles of Software's TAs and mentors for their contributions of student grading and course advice,

Dr. Barb Cutler and the Submitty team for making grading Principles of Software possible,

and Dr. Konstantin Kuzmin, who oversaw, edited, and guided the author in the creation of this publication.
