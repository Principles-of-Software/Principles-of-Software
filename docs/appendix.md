## Halting Problem

The halting problem is a classic problem in computer science that asks whether it is possible to determine whether the program will run indefinitely or eventually halt, given a program and its input.  In other words, it asks whether there is an algorithm that can determine whether a given program will run forever or will eventually stop.

The halting problem is important because it highlights the limitations of what can be computed by a computer.  It was first proposed by mathematician Alan Turing in 1936 and is considered a fundamental problem in the theory of computation.

## Rice's Theorem

Rice's Theorem is a fundamental result in computer science that states that it is impossible to design an algorithm that can determine whether a given program will ever halt or run forever unless the program is trivial.  In other words, it is impossible to design an algorithm to determine whether a given program will eventually halt or run forever, unless the program is so simple that it can be easily analyzed by hand.

Rice's Theorem is important because it highlights the limitations of what can be computed by a computer.  It was first proposed by mathematician Henry Gordon Rice in 1953 and is considered a fundamental result in the theory of computation.

## Russel's Paradox

Russell's Paradox is a paradox that arises in set theory when trying to define a set that includes all sets that do not contain themselves as elements.  The paradox arises because such a set cannot be a member of itself, since it contains all sets that do not contain themselves.

Russell's Paradox is important because it highlights the limitations of defining certain types of sets.  It was first proposed by mathematician Bertrand Russell in 1901 and is considered a fundamental problem in the foundations of mathematics.

## Java ADTs

Here is an exciting and helpful [article](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/java-abstract-data-type/) on ADTs, written by the developers at TechVidvan in 2022.

## Dafny

Here is a [lecture](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~scd/Dafny\_Material/Lectures.pdf) by Will Sonnex and Sophia Drossopoulou of Microsoft on some of the uses and syntax of Dafny.

## OpenJML

Here is the [source code](https://www.openjml.org/examples/binary-search.html) for the OpenJML example in the Specifications section.

## Design Patterns

All example java design patterns are from [fluffycat.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20080208110123/http://www.fluffycat.com/), a website Dr. Kuzmin has used extensively in PSoft, which is now hosted on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).

Thanks to Brian K. for pointing out that the singleton design pattern example was not type-safe.

## Gang of Four

The Gang of Four (GOF) is a nickname for the four authors of the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," published in 1994.  The authors of the book are Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

The book is considered a classic in software engineering and has significantly influenced the development of object-oriented programming.  It presents a catalog of common design patterns that can be used to solve common software design problems, and it is considered a valuable resource for software designers and developers.

Here are some resources to learn more about the Gang of Four and their work:

## Software Errors

This is an [article](https://raygun.com/blog/costly-software-errors-history/) detailing some gruesome and cringeworthy software errors whose effects were felt worldwide.

## Induction

Mary Barnes and Sue Gordon, of The University of Sydney, provided some definitions and explorations of induction in [their paper](https://docplayer.net/21121808-Mathematical-induction-mary-barnes-sue-gordon.html) titled Mathematical Induction.

## Testing

Examples and early iterations of graphics originated from Imperva's [article](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/black-box-testing/) on black box testing.

## Github

Let us remember where this whole project started.  Dr. Konstantin Kuzmin provided the code examples used in lectures as fodder for this textbook.  Many of these examples appear in these pages or on the website.

Students are encouraged to look through the rest of the repository to solidify their understanding of these concepts.
