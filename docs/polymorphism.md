# Parametric Polymorphism: Generics
Explicit Parametric Polymorphism is the technical term for generic usage in object-oriented languages.

Generics clarify code.  Without generics, code has pseudo-generic containers.  **Type Erasure** happens when all type parameters in generic types are within their bounds.  Thus, the produced bytecode contains only ordinary classes, interfaces, and methods.  Type casts can be inserted if necessary to improve type safety.  Type erasure ensures that no new classes are created for parameterized types.  Consequently, generics incur no runtime overhead.

Generic methods can be called with arguments of different types.  Based on the types of arguments passed to the generic method, the compiler handles each method call appropriately: 

All generic method declarations have a type parameter section delimited by angle brackets (< and >) that precede the method's return type.  For example:

    class MySet<T> {
        // rep invariant: non-null, 
        // contains no duplicates List<T> 
        List<T> theRep;
        T lastLookedUp;
    }
    MySet<String> s;
    MySet<Integer> intSet;
    MySet<int> i; // compiler error, doesn't autobox

Each type parameter section contains one or more type parameters separated by commas.  A type parameter, also known as a type variable, is an identifier that specifies a generic type name.

Type parameters can be used to declare a method's return type, and act as placeholders for argument types passed to the generic method, also known as **Actual Type** arguments.

A generic method's body is declared like that of any other method.  Note that type parameters can represent only reference types, not primitive types (like int, double, and char).  For example:
    
    public class GenericMethodDemo { 
    // generic method printArray
        public static <E> void printArray( E[] inputArray ) { 
            // Display array elements
            for(E element : inputArray) { 
                System.out.print(element + " ");
            } 
            System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // Create arrays of Integer, Double, and Character
        Integer[] intArray = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        Double[] doubleArray = { 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4 }; 
        Character[] charArray = {'H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O'};
        
        System.out.println("Array integerArray contains:"); 
        printArray(intArray); // pass an Integer array
        
        System.out.println("\nArray doubleArray contains:"); 
        printArray(doubleArray); // pass a Double array

        System.out.println("\nArray characterArray contains:"); 
        printArray(charArray); // pass a Character array
    }

The compiler ensures type compatibility when using generics, so all code components work well together.  Java generics are explicitly polymorphic, so developers cannot assign illegal types to objects, like adding a cat object to an array list full of dog objects.

## How does a method call execute?}\
For example, x.foo(5);

The compiler determines what class to look in at compile time: the **Compile Time Class**.  Then, it determines the method signature - the **Method Family**:
The compiler finds all methods in the class with the correct name, including inherited methods.
It looks for method overrides and return types that may be subtypes of the desired outcome.  The types of the actual arguments (e.g., 5 has type int above) must be the same, or be subtypes of the corresponding formal parameter type.

The compiler keeps only methods that are accessible.  For example, a private method is not accessible to calls from outside the class.  The compiler keeps track of the method's signature (argument types) for runtime.

At run time, the compiler determines the runtime type of the receiver - x in this case.  Then, it looks at the object in the heap to determine its runtime type.  Next, it locates the method to invoke; starting with the runtime type, look for a method with the correct name and argument types found statically in the method family.  The types of the actual arguments may be the same or subtypes of the corresponding formal parameter type.  If it is found in the runtime type, then invoke it.  Otherwise, continue the search in the superclass of the runtime type.  The compiler looks only at method-family members.  This procedure will always find a method to invoke due to the checks done during static type checking.

## Parametric Polymorphism
Overloading is typically referred to as "ad-hoc" polymorphism.  In contrast, in **Parametric Polymorphism**, methods take type as a parameter.  In python, there are no explicit type parameters; the code is "polymorphic" because it works with many different types by default.

**Subtype Polymorphism** is the ability to use a subclass where a superclass is expected.  There are no explicit type parameters in **Implicit Parametric Polymorphism**, yet the code works on many different types.  How does Implicit Parametric Polymorphism differ from subtype polymorphism?  Subtype polymorphism is static, and implicit parametric polymorphism is dynamic.  Subtype polymorphism requires declared types for iterable types.  Subtype polymorphism guarantees that every subclass of the declared type will be iterable!  Java subtyping guarantees that when intersect is called, the runtime iterable types will implement iteration!  With subtype polymorphism, the compiler prevents calling intersect(2,2), for example. 

Python, Perl, Scheme, and other dynamic languages use Implicit Parametric Polymorphism; there is no explicit type parameter(s).  As a result, the code works with many different types.  Usually, there is a single copy of the code, and all type checking is delayed until runtime.  The code works if the arguments are of type as expected by the code.  If not, the code issues a type error at runtime.

C++, Java, and C\# use Explicit **Parametric Polymorphism**, which has explicit type parameter(s) for variables and methods.  Explicit Parametric Polymorphism is also known as Genericity.  For example, in C++, we have templates.  Usually, templates are implemented by creating multiple copies of the generic code, one for each concrete type argument, then compiling.  Problem: if the "wrong" type argument is instantiated, the C++ compiler gives us long, cryptic error messages referring to the generic (templated) code in the Standard Template Library (STL).

Java generics work differently from C++ templates -- there is more type-checking on generic code.  Object Oriented languages usually have both subtype and explicit parametric polymorphism, referred to as either generics or templates.

## Using Generics
Defining a Generic Class looks something like below:

        class MySet<T> {
            // rep invariant: non-null, 
            // contains no duplicates 
            List<T> theRep;
            T lastLookedUp;
        }
        
    MySet<String> s;
    MySet<Integer> intSet;
    MySet<int> i; // compiler error, doesn't autobox

The convention is to use a 1-letter name, such as T, for type.  The client supplies type arguments to instantiate generic classes.

## Bounded Types
**Bounded Types** are generic types that extend preexisting classes.

An upper bound type argument can be some type or any of its subtypes in bounded types.  The upper bound on a type parameter has three effects:

1. Restricted Instantiation.  The upper bound restricts the set of types that can be used for instantiation of the generic type - `<T extends Number>` means T can be instantiated as a Number or an Integer.
2. Access to Non-Static Members.  The upper bound gives access to all upper-bound public non-static methods and fields.  In the class `Box<T extends Number?>`  we can invoke all public non-static methods defined in class Number, such as intValue()
3. Type Erasure.  The leftmost upper bound is used for type erasure and replaces the type parameter in bytecode.  For example, in class `Box<T extends Number>`, all occurrences of T would be replaced by the upper bound Number.

Why doesn't Java allow Lower Bounded Type Parameters?  Two reasons:

1. Access to Non-Static Members.  A lower-type parameter bound does not give access to any particular methods beyond those inherited from class Objects.  In `Box<T super Number>`, the supertypes of Number have nothing in common, except that they are reference types and, therefore, subtypes of Object.
2. **Type Erasure** replaces all occurrences of the type variable T by type Object and not by its lower bound.  The lower bound would have the same effect as a "no bound."

The bottom line is that `<T super Type>` does not get anyone anywhere and leads to confusion.

## Java Wildcards
A wildcard is an anonymous type variable.  Use `?` when using a type variable exactly once.  `?` appears at the instantiation site of the generic - the use site, as opposed to the declaration site.  Thus, `<?  extends E>`, but not `<E extends ?>`.  The purpose of the wildcard is to make a library more flexible and easier to use by allowing limited subtyping.  Wildcards limit the kind of operations that instances of a class can perform.

Wildcards appear at the instantiations of generic objects.  There is also `<?  super E>`.  Intuitively, why `<?  extends E>` makes sense here.  The syntax `<?  extends E>` means "some type that either is E or a subtype of E."

`?  extends` introduces covariant subtyping.  For example, `Apple` is a subtype of `Fruit`, `Strawberry` is a subtype of `Fruit`, and `List<Apple>` is a subtype of `List<?  extends Fruit>`.  

    List<Apple> apples = new ArrayList<Apple>(); 
    List<?  extends Fruit> fruits = apples; 
    fruits.add(new Strawberry());

The above code, as is, will not compile.  `fruits.add(new Fruit());` wonâ€™t compile either.

The purpose of the wildcard is to allow for subtyping!  The type declaration `List<?  extends Integer>` means that every `List< type>` such that type `extends` Integer, is a subtype of `List<?  extends Integer>` (and thus can be used where `List<? extends Integer>` is expected).  Covariant subtyping must be restricted to immutable lists.  `lei` can be read but cannot be written into (because writing is unsafe).  `p = lei.get(0)` fails because `lei.get(0)` can return an `Integer`. We need a supertype on the left of the `=`.  The problem with `lei.add()` is that the compiler does not know what type of list `lei` is at runtime.  The compiler does not know what arguments will be passed at runtime, so it disallows these `add()`s.

Use `<?  extends T>` when getting values from a producer; use `<?  super T>` when addding values into a consumer, e.g. <T> void copy(List<? super T> DST, List<? extends T> src).   Use PECS: Producer Extends Consumer Super.  Use the "?  extends" wildcard to retrieve an object from a data structure.  Use the "?  super" wildcard to put objects in a data structure.  Wildcards are not needed when both reading and writing.

All type arguments become Objects or type bounds when compiled.  This is due to backward compatibility with outdated bytecode.  At runtime, all generic instantiations have the same type, so developers cannot use instanceOf to find type arguments at that point.  What happens, then, to equals() on elements of generic type?
\\
\\
Early versions of Java did not include generics.  If arrays were not covariant, something like boolean equalArrays(Object[] a1, Object [] a2); would only work with Objects.  There would have to be a different method for every type combination.  When generics were introduced, they were purposefully not made covariant to prevent strange subtype phenomena from happening.  When writing a generic class, start by writing a concrete class.  Make sure it is correct using reasoning and testing.  Then, think about writing a second, more concrete class, with different types.  How would the original class need to be modified to accommodate generics?  With practice, it gets easier to start with generics.

\subsection{Contravariance}
A programming language can have features that may support the following subtyping rules:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Covariant: A feature that allows a subtype to replace a supertype, like the Java covariant return type
    \item Contravariant: A feature that allows a supertype to replace a subtype, such as contravariant argument types; these apply to Overloads in Java rather than overrides
    \item Bivariant: A feature that is both covariant and contravariant.
    \item Invariant: A feature that does not allow any of the above substitutions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Review}
Do not use raw types because Eclipse complains.  Do not use private final Collection, and do not use raw iterators.  Raw types lose type safety.  Eliminate warnings as much as possible, and add comments.  Use lists instead of arrays because lists are more type-safe than arrays.
\\
\\
Use generic types rather than fixed types.  This makes code more flexible, and making classes generic without affecting client code is straightforward.  Generic methods are helpful in the same way.
\\
\\
Use bounded wildcards to enhance flexibility.
