# Mentors

Mentors are the life blood of RCOS; a mentor can help you with technical problems, show you where/how to find help for your project, help you find a new project, etc.

### Perks of being an RCOS Mentor

- Grading for Mentors is more lenient
- Gain valuable leadership and mentoring experience
- Be exposed to interesting technologies through the projects you mentor

### Mentor Responsibilities

- Review project proposals at the start of the semester.
- Look after a Small Group of projects and their members as your mentees (usually ~2 mentors per Small Group).
  - Grade Status Updates for your mentees
  - Grade Mid-Year Reviews for your mentees
- Meet once a week with said Small Groups to ensure your mentees are on their schedule OR have documented reasons to be off their schedule.
- Host at least one [workshop session](/events/hosting) for the RCOS community
- Help point students to what they need to do/where they need to go within RCOS.
- Set up whatever organization/goal structure you feel is best for helping students be successful with their open source contributions; this is what gives a Small Group personality.
- In general, help maintain the freedom and culture of RCOS and encourage open source contribution.

### Becoming a Mentor

Before the start of each semester, a Mentor application form will be published. Mentors are ideally selected before the first meeting and are assigned to Small Groups and projects by meeting 4. Keep an eye out for this call for Mentors before each semester! If you proactively reach out, that improves your chances of being selected.

### Mentor Grading

Mentors typically take RCOS for credit and therefore are subject to the RCOS grading rubric. However, since mentoring comes with its own responsibilities, the requirements are more lax and the details can be found [here](/grading/rubric?id=grading-rubric-for-mentors).

## External Mentors

External mentors are mentors that help projects remotely. External mentors serve a different role than regular student mentors.

In particular, they get the following exceptions:

- External mentors don't need to attend Small and Large Group meetings
- External mentors don't need to understand the logistics of RCOS (students should ask their student mentors for this)

External mentors have their own sets of requirements, usually they provide a subset of the following responsibilities...

- Get students involved with industry or personal projects outside of RCOS
- Assist students with problems with a technology stack
- Introduce students to new technologies
- Provide advice to students regarding open source technologies
