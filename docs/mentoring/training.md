# Mentor Training

RCOS can't function without its Mentors. This page has all the documentation you need to start mentoring and flourish as an RCOS Mentor.

While some information here might be common knowledge to long-time Mentors, it also has useful specifics that would benefit Mentors with all levels of experience. Be sure to read and familiarize yourself with the information here each semester you mentor!

## Agenda

- Time Commitments
- Semester Overview
- Managing a Small Group
- Helping in Large Group
- Grading
- Taking Attendance
- Handling Code of Conduct Violations

## When Is This Covered?

We aim to have the first Mentor training meeting of each semester immediately following the first RCOS meeting of the semester.

## Mentor Time Commitments

The extra time commitment to being a Mentor is minimal. Besides being present for the typical twice a week RCOS meetings for 1-2 hours, we expect Mentors to commit to:

- Mentor meetings
  - typically every other week, but potentially once a week at times
  - 30min - 1hr during the second half of Small Group meetings
- Hosting at least one [Workshop](/events/workshops)
  - 30min - 1hr typically on Wednesdays but up to Mentor

### Semester Overview

Mentors have impact throughout the entire semester.

The first two weeks agenda can be found [here](leadership/agenda). This time is always hectic for the Coordinators and Faculty Advisors as we introduce RCOS, run project pitches, project pairing, and form Small Groups.
As a mentor, you are expected to help out with Project Pairing and proposal approval. This involves pointing students to the right locations and looking over project proposals to make sure they meet the basic [requirements](grading/documentation?id=proposal).

During the middle of the semester, you will be managing your Small Group both during and outside of RCOS meetings. You will be grading weekly status updates, taking meeting attendance, and providing support and/or direction to your mentees when it is needed.

During the end of the semester, you will review your mentee projects' presentations before they actually present, ensure that your mentees know how well they are doing in RCOS, and help in grading Final Presentations and Final Reviews.

## Managing a Small Group

A description of Small Group meetings for RCOS members can be found [here](meetings/small_group_meetings).

As a Mentor, you will be assigned to a Small Group before Small Group meetings start. Depending on then number of Mentors for the semester, you will hopefully have 1-2 other Mentors in your Small Group. Your main role is to run Small Group meetings, go through the day's slides at the start of the meeting, be present to help your mentees or point them to who can help during meetings, take attendance at the end of the meetings, and be knowledgeable on what the projects in your Small Group are up to.

You should make an effort to get to know every project and project member in your Small Group. Ask about projects and progress, both to get to know your mentees and also to identify mentees who have blockers or who aren't making progress.

### Meeting Slides

Check Discord's #slides channel for the day's slides before each meeting. **Please familiarize yourself with the slides prior to presenting them.** Ask any questions in the #mentors channel. At the start of Small Group meetings, one Mentor should present the slides from their device to the attendees. It is vital that you do this, as important RCOS announcements, updates, opportunities, deadlines, etc. are conveyed in the meeting slides.

The suggested agenda for each Small Group meeting is:

- welcome everyone
- present meeting slides
- quick standup
- open hacking
- attendance after 1hr 30min - 1hr 50min

### Project Check-ins

As a Mentor, it's vital to keep up with the projects in your Small Group on a weekly basis. You should get to know what each project is about, the goals the Project Leads have in mind, and the general experience levels of project members. It is up to you on how you want to check in on projects each week, but we recommend either scrum standup's (detailed below) or personally speaking with projects directly during Small Group meetings.

#### Standups

?> Standups are recommended for smaller Small Groups as it might take too long when there are 15+ mentees, yet they have the benefit of giving other projects updates on their peer projects. For larger Small Groups, just speak directly to projects instead of having them hold up the whole meeting by talking aloud.

During a standup, everyone physically stands up and very concisely gives one statement on each of the following:

- their progress from the following week
- their plans for the current/next week
- any **technical** blockers

As a Mentor, it is your job to ensure your mentees give substantive but concise answers, and it is your job to actually listen to progress and blockers in case you can help!

## Grading

One of a Mentor's most important and helpful responsibilites is grading their mentees' Status Updates, Mid-year Review, and Final Review. Currently, grading takes place through Submitty. At the start of the semester, you will be added as a Grader on the RCOS Submitty course. You will be assigned to only grade assignments for your Small Group mentees. The first Mentor Meeting will show what this looks like in Submitty.

In general, as a Mentor you must familiarize yourself with the RCOS [grading rubric](grading/rubric) so that you can answer mentees' questions. In short, in order of grading weight the rubric is: contributions, status updates/documentation, presentation, attendance Point your mentees to this Handbook for the most up-to-date information.

Mentors are asked to grade/review

- Project proposals - for each project once at the start of the semester
- Status Updates - for each mentee weekly
- Mid-year Review - for each mentee once in the middle of the semester
- Final Review - for each mentee once at the end of the semester
- Final Presentations - for each mentee project once at the end of the semester

## Taking Attendance

Attendance is an important part of RCOS. While it is a small factor of the grade, missing attendance likely results in fewer and poorer open source contributions and causes issues for projects and Project Leads. As a Mentor of a Small Group, it is your job to ensure those who attend get attendance credit, and those that miss many meetings are contacted.

Currently, attendance is handled by some form of Venue. The first Mentor Meeting of the semester will go over exact details. It will take the form of showing a QR code or similar on your screen at the end of meetings.

If you ever find instances of attendance fraud, let a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor know immediately. This has happened in the past.

## Handling Code of Conduct Violations

Please familiarize yourselves with our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) and [Bylaws](community/bylaws). As a Mentor, you are not only expected to follow these, but to enforce them where appropriate.

Any violations warranting more than a verbal/Discord warning (e.g. repeated offenses, harassment) should be reported to Coordinators/Faculty Advisors, who will then determine the appropriate action(s) necessary.

## Hosting a Workshop

Mentors are required to host **at least one** workshop for the RCOS community each semester. Read about workshop requirements [here](events/workshops). Coordinators will post the link to proposing workshops at the start of the semester and allow you to choose a topic and date/time.
