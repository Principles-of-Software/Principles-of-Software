# How to join RCOS

## RPI Students

RCOS runs each semester of the school year, including summer semesters. You can participate either by either taking the course for credit or no credit. If you take RCOS for credit, you must meet all of the requirements described in [Grading](grading/README) in order to receive a grade. If not taking for credit, you can participate in the same way but are not held to any requirements.

### 1. Register for RCOS Course

When course registration opens, search for RCOS in SIS/QuACS/YACS and register for the section that has the number of credits you want to take RCOS for. The credit count is factored into grading. You will also be able to show up to the first RCOS meeting of the semester and register via SIS then, but it is best to do this as soon as possible!

### 2. Register on Telescope

Log into [Telescope](https://rcos.io) with CAS to register as an RCOS member in our database.

### 3. Join Discord Server

RCOS uses Discord for all communication. It is required that you join the RCOS Discord server for updates, announcements, and team communication throughout the semester. Once you have logged into Telescope, [connect your Discord account](https://rcos.io/link/discord) which will add you to the Discord server. Here you'll be able to reach out to Faculty Advisors, Coordinators, Mentors, and your fellow members!

### 4. Attend First Meeting

The first RCOS meeting of each semester is on either the first Tuesday or Friday of the semester at 4pm. Typically these large meetings take place in DCC 318, but always check SIS for the actual location!

<!-- RCOS is a group of RPI students who work on open source projects. Our members work on a variety of projects, which can be seen on the projects page. To see the presentation schedule look here. -->

<!-- Benefits of being an RCOS member -->
<!-- - The opportunity to help society by creating useful software. -->
<!-- - An excellent environment to share your skills with your peers and learn from them as well -->
<!-- - Great practice in the code review process, a very important skill for your software career! -->
<!-- - Practice giving and receiving feedback. Learning how to discuss technical and non-technical aspects of a project in a constructive fashion is a critical skill that employers look for! -->

<!-- Students can participate in RCOS for course credit or for a stipend. At the beginning of each semester, the Internal Advisory Board will review project proposals and decide which projects should receive financial support. -->

<!-- ## Finding a project

[GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) allows you to explore GitHub and find awesome open source projects to contribute to. Spend a good amount of time finding a project that you like. Don't be intimidated! Many projects that seem very complicated are actively looking for new contributors and will give you "easy" issues to get started. You'll learn fast! Feel free to tackle issues as a team. -->
