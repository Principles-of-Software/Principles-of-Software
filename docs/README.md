# Principles of Software

Welcome to RPI's legendary CSCI 2600, otherwise known as **Principles of Software**.

The class is a study of important concepts in software design, implementation, and testing. 
Topics include specification, abstraction, design principles and patterns, testing, refactoring, software 
development processes, and GUI and event-driven programming. The course also introduces implementation and 
testing tools, including IDEs, version control systems, and other frameworks. **The overarching goal of the course 
is for students to learn how to write correct and maintainable software.**

Ideally, this book will also include a chapter on ethics in computing, more in-depth examples of Dafny, design pattern
usage, and real-world applications.  The motivation for this material comes from its necessity -

RPI's motto used to be "Knowledge and Thoroughness", an ideal that still sets RPI engineers apart from other
technologists and programmers alike.  In our specialties, we are often self-taught; most times,
our knowledge and/or applicative need expands farther than a class can take us, so we must learn on our own.
Principles of Software is a deeply important class for budding programmers, and the author believes these concepts
must be more readily available and digestible than they currently are as of this writing.

## Acknowledgements

The spirit of this textbook is based on the RCOS Handbook, the document on which another RPI class, Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS), is based.  Both documents are maintained and updated by CS Department Faculty as well as students, who have graciously edited this textbook via its open-source counterpart.

The content of this textbook is not original work; it is a compilation of a series of papers, slideshows, lectures, and book excerpts from leaders in the field of computer science.  As such, the credit for the content in this book goes entirely to:

Dr. Ana Milanova of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,

Dr. David Goldschmidt of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,

Dr. Carlos Varela of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,

Dr. Michael Ernst of the University of Washington,

Dr. David Notkin of the University of Washington,

and Professor Thompson of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

All resources, sources, quotes, and some extra ideas are dully cited in the Appendix.

This book would also not be possible without:

All of the Principles of Software's TAs and mentors for their contributions to student grading and course advice,

Dr. Barb Cutler and the Submitty team for making grading Principles of Software possible,

and Dr. Konstantin Kuzmin, who created the slide deck on which this book is largely based, and who oversaw the author in the creation of this publication.

## Textbook

This is a living document meant to supplement and improve upon RPI's Principles of Software course.  Users are encouraged to use it as such, as well as a launching point for further reading into these subjects.

On this website, important vocabulary words are denoted in **Bold**, with their definitions following in <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>.  This was done to clarify important text, as well as for creating flashcards so students may study the material.

The only exception to the above rule is the Introduction chapter, which does not contain any definitions.  Words defined later appear there in blue.
