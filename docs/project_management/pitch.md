# Project Pitch

At the start of each semester, **project leads** that are looking for members can pitch their project to the entire RCOS community. This usally happens during the second and third meetings of the semester during Pitch Days. This is a single slide show including:
- Project name
- Project lead(s)
- Very brief project description
- Project stack
- What kind of members you are looking for, e.g.
    - "Beginners are welcome"
    - "Python experience preferred"
    - "Graphic design experience preferred"
- Repository link *if existing project*

?> You will be directed where to submit your pitch before Pitch Days begin. Be sure to get them started as soon as possible.

### Pitch Days

On Pitch Days, project leads will get a chance to give a elevator-pitch for their project to potential members. Generally, previously exisiting projects pitch first to provide an example for new projects. Left over existing projects and new projects pitch on the second day. Pitches must be **concise** as we often have a long list of projects to get through. The order of appearance will be posted beforehand. Be prepared to answer questions from interested members after pitching.
