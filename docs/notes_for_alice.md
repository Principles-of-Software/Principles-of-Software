# Textbook Repository

Remember to modify the [sidebar](https://github.com/alicebibaud/Principles-of-Software/blob/master/docs/_sidebar.md) whenever you add or remove a page from the handbook!

## Developing

Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the suggested ways to preview your changes locally. You can also directly make edits through GitHub, but it is strongly recommended you create and view them locally instead.

## Deploying

The Textbook will be automatically deployed using GitHub pages, and has `textbook.psoft.io` set as the custom domain in the repostiory settings. This means that the Handbook is automatically updated when the master branch is updated and can be located at <https://textbook.psoft.io>!
