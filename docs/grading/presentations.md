# Presentation Guidelines

Each project group is required to give a final presentation at the end of the semester. Typically the last 4 RCOS meetings are dedicated to project presentations. Presentations should be well prepared and rehearsed in the presence of a Mentor for feedback. Final Presentations factor into your RCOS grade. See the categories below for what is required and the grading weight of each category.

?> We know that presentations can be stressful. RCOS presentations are meant to be fun and informational. Don't worry too much about them. Follow the guidelines below and you'll be great!

### Effectiveness of Presentation (30%)

Ensure your presentation is well-rehearsed, concise, and not too long. Your should give your audience an organized idea of what happened (good/bad/unexpected) in the semester. You should aim for **10 minutes**.

### Title (10%)

Include your full project title in your presentation!

### Teammates (10%)

Ensure every team member taking RCOS for credit is involved in the presentation! This could take the form of a "what I contributed" slide for each member, but it is preferred if the presentation has a coherent narrative and project members discuss different aspects of it.

### Description (20%)

Describe your project to an audience that has no prior familiarity with it. Explain the purpose of the project and the specific technologies used. Feel free to touch on why you chose the particular stack.

### Organization (20%)

Where is your project hosted? Do you use GitHub Issues, Project Boards, Wiki, etc. for project management? How are you set up with respect to building community? Do you have guidelines for new contributors? Getting started documentation? Do you need it? Screenshots are good for this section.

### Progress (10%)

Show proof of the progress you made **over this semester.** What goals did you reach? Which did you not reach? Be honest! Aim for a demo, either recorded or live. If live, be sure to have a backup recording in case it [goes south](https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aR08njG_700bwp.webp).
