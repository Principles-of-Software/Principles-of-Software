# Attendance Guidelines

## Overview

Being part of the RCOS community means seeing what RCOS members are doing, giving feedback, and learning from tech talks and guest speakers.

Attendance at RCOS is required for:

- all Small Group meetings
- all mandatory Large Group meetings
- at least 1 workshop bonus session

You may miss up to two meetings (small or Large Group combined) without an excuse and can make up at most two meetings by attending more than the required number of bonus, work, or workshop sessions.

!> For example, imagine you have not yet attended a bonus session (1 is required) and you miss a Small Group meeting. In order to make up for that missed attendance, you must first attend a bonus session to meet your requirement, and then another bonus session to make up for the unexcused absence. You can make up for at most 2 unexcused absences in this way.

Unexcused absences beyond those allowed will impact your grade.
We understand that there are occasional conflicts that require you to be absent from an RCOS meeting without a formal excuse.
Please see a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor prior to any conflicts to make arrangements.

## Bonus Sessions

Unexcused absences can be made up by attending bonus sessions. Bonus sessions can be fulfilled by attending any of the following events:

- [Mentor/Member Workshops](/events/workshops)
  <!-- - [Casual Coding Sessions](/events/casual_coding_sessions) -->
  <!-- - [Tech Talks](/events/tech_talks) -->
  <!-- - [Code Jams](/events/code_jams) -->
- [Hackathons](/events/hackathons)
<!-- - [Accepted Students Day](/events/accepted_students_day) -->

Pay attention to the slides each meeting to hear Bonus Session announcements!

## Excused Absence Policy

Excused absences can be given for any of the following:

- Illnesses / injuries
- Family emergencies
- Job interviews
- Graduate school visits
- Religious holidays
- Conferences
- External hackathons
- Schedule conflicts with courses, exams, or extracurriculars
  - In order to receive an excused absence, this conflict must take place during your scheduled large or Small Group session.

The above list is not exhaustive. If you are unsure about what constitutes an excused absence, please reach out to a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor. However, excused absences will **not** be given if you are removed from a meeting for violating our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) or our [Bylaws](community/bylaws.md).

Excused absences do **not** need to be made up with a bonus session (but you are encouraged to come to bonus sessions regardless!).

### Requesting Excused Absences

Currently, in order to request an excused absence, you must contact a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor.

For foreseen absences (e.g. hackathons, conferences, job/grad school interviews, etc), this must be done at least 48 hours in advance of the first session you will miss.

For unforeseen absences (e.g. illness, family emergency), this must be done within 1 week of returning to RCOS.

For extenuating circumstances, please speak to a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor directly.

In the future, functionality will be implemented to request excused absences!

## Resolving Attendance Issues

In the event that you see an issue in Submitty Rainbow Grades or another report of your attendance, reach out to a Coordinator so that we can verify and fix it. This might happen, for example, if a Mentor hosting a workshop you attend forgets to submit your attendance for it.
