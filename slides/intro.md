### What is RCOS

RCOS is a community of motivated students at RPI who develop open source projects under the guidance of experienced instructors and student mentors.

RCOS is also a venue for open learning and student teaching, as well as exploring the world of open source.

---

### Mission Statement

To cultivate an inclusive, creative, and entrepreneurial community that seeks to empower students to develop open-source solutions to real-world problems.

---

### RCOS is anarchy

(but for real)

Every RCOS member is an _agent of change_ within the organization.

---

### We still have rules!
