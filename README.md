# RCOS Handbook

Organization documentation for RCOS leadership, members, and external users.

This is intended to be a thorough, living document detailing the organizational practices of RCOS at every level. If you find a problem or something that you'd like to dispute, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rcos/handbook/issues/new).

Built with [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org)

Remember to modify the [sidebar](https://github.com/rcos/rcos-handbook/blob/master/docs/_sidebar.md) whenever you add or remove a page from the handbook!

## Developing

Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the suggested ways to preview your changes locally. You can also directly make edits through GitHub but it is strongly recommended you do them and view them locally instead.

## Deploying

The Handbook is automatically deployed using GitHub pages, and has `handbook.rcos.io` set as the custom domain in the repostiory settings. This means that the Handbook is automatically updated when the master branch is updated and can be located at <https://handbook.rcos.io>!
