# Principles of Software Textbook

This is a living textbook meant to supplement and improve upon RPI's CSCI 2600, 

otherwise known as Principles of Software.

The class is a study of important concepts in software design, implementation, and testing. 
Topics include specification, abstraction, design principles and patterns, testing, refactoring, software 
development processes, and GUI and event-driven programming. The course also introduces implementation and 
testing tools, including IDEs, version control systems, and other frameworks. **The overarching goal of the course 
is for students to learn how to write correct and maintainable software.**

Ideally, this book will also include a chapter on ethics in computing, more in-depth examples of Dafny, design pattern
usage, and real world applications.  The motivation for this material comes from its necessity -

RPI's motto used to be "Knowledge and Thoroughness", an ideal which still sets RPI engineers apart from other
technologists and programmers alike.  In our specialties, we are often self-taught; most times,
our knowledge and / or applicative need expands farther than a class can take us, so we must learn on our own.
Principles of Software is a deeply important class to budding programmers, and the author believes these concepts
must be more readily available and digestible than they currently are as of this writing.
